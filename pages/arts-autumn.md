## Introduction

Real-time system
: "Any information processing system which has to respond to externally generated input stimuli within a finite and specified period". 
   Correctness may depend on _when_ the result is delivered, not just on _what_ result is delivered

Embedded [computer] system
: Where a computer "is a component in a larger engineering system". 99% of all processors are for this market, apparently

Hard real-time
: "Where it is absolutely imperative that responses occur within the required deadline"

Soft real-time
: Deadlines important, but system can still function if deadlines are missed sometimes

Firm real-time
: Like soft, but where late delivery of service is as bad as no delivery at all

Time-aware
: "System makes explicit reference to time"

Reactive
: Deadline measured from time of input

Time-triggered
: "Triggered by the passage of time". Might be **periodic**

Event-triggered
: Triggered by external or internal event. **Sporadic** if there's a bound on the event's _arrival interval_, **aperiodic** otherwise


## Computational models

### Control loop

~~~
loop
  read from sensors (in)
  out := G(S,in)
  S := F(S,in)
  write to actuators (out)
end loop
~~~

`S`
: Internal state, an arbitrary data structure

`G` and `F`
: Arbitrary complex functions

Sampling frequency
: How often the environmental quantity must be sampled. Determined by the environmental quantity's nature

Input jitter
: Bound on variability of sampling frequency  (`read from sensors (in) within 2ms`)

Period, T
: The reciprocal of the sampling frequency, and a more popular way of specifying it

Deadline, D
: Maximum time between start of loop and completion of output (`loop every 25ms` [...] `write to actuators (out) within 15ms`)

Output jitter
: Constraint on output being produced too early (`write to actuators (out) after 12ms`)

Worst-case execution time (WCET), C
: Obvious, right?


### Event loop

For event-triggered activities.

~~~
loop
  wait for event (in)
  out := G(S,in)
  S := F(S,in)
  write to actuators (out)
end loop
~~~

Deadline
: Measured from time of event

Period, T
: Bound on how often the event can be fired? (Simplest bound: say there is a minimum time interval between events)

#### Timed event loop

~~~
loop at most every T
  wait for event (in)
  out := G(S,in)
  S := F(S,in)
  write to actuators (out) within D
end loop
~~~

### Sporadic events

Where the event source has a **minimum arrival interval**.

### Aperiodic events

Where the event source _doesn't_ have a minimum arrival interval.

#### Aperiodic loop

~~~
loop with (10ms every 50ms)
  wait for event (in)
  S := F(S,in)
  out := G(S,in)
  write to actuators (out) within 30ms
end loop
~~~

## Task interactions

Recall the "state", `S`, from the control loop mentioned above.
This state may be shared with other computations, which complicates matters.

Separate computations must wait to access the state.
This must be done properly: we don't want a tight-deadline computation to be waiting for one that has a long one.

### Cyclic exectutives

One approach to scheduling. Happen to be **completely deterministic**, which is cool.

"The design is concurrent but the code is produced as a collection of procedures."
