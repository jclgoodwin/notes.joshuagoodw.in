## Block 0: Foundations

### What is enterprise architecture?

* A thing: models of an organisation, giving a holistic view
* A process: producing and maintaining those models

([There's chess and there's a game of chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFD01r6ersw))

### Benefits

Clear and consistent view of enterprise facilitates decision making and planning

An organisation might want to identify and reduce waste, adhere to new regulations (e.g. the Clinger--Cohen act )
... or generally better meet its goals and, at the end of the day, make more money

### Challenges

* Consistency -- both internally and with the enterprise being modelled
* Using EA to make informed and timely decisions
* Assessing fitness-for-purpose

### Goals and implications

Goal
: intended benefit (of applying EA)

Implication
: (positive or negative) likely consequence (of applying EA)

### Perspectives

* Business
* Data
* Technology
* Infrastructure
* Applications

These are realised as models and views in enterprise architecture frameworks. Models help to give views structure.

## Block 1: Introduction to standards and frameworks

### Zachman

Not really a framework (says Roger Sessions),
but rather a taxonomy ("The Enterprise Ontologyâ„¢") used to identify stakeholders
and the roles they play in a business process.

|             | What     | How | Where | Who | When | Why |
|-------------+----------+-----+-------+-----+------+-----|
| Stakeholder | Artifact |     |       |     |      |     |
| Stakeholder |      	 |     |       |     |      |     |
| Stakeholder |      	 |     |       |     |      |     |
| Stakeholder |      	 |     |       |     |      |     |
| Stakeholder |      	 |     |       |     |      |     |
| Stakeholder |      	 |     |       |     |      |     |
