## Block 0: Foundations

### What is enterprise architecture?

* A thing: models of an organisation, giving a holistic view
* A process: producing and maintaining those models

([There's chess and there's a game of chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFD01r6ersw))

### Benefits

Clear and consistent view of enterprise facilitates decision making and planning

An organisation might want to identify and reduce waste, adhere to new regulations ... or generally better meet its goals and, at the end of the day, make more money

### Challenges

* Consistency -- both internally and with the enterprise being modelled
* Using EA to make informed and timely decisions
* Assessing fitness-for-purpose

### Goals and implications

Goal
: intended benefit (of applying EA)

Implication
: (positive or negative) likely consequence (of applying EA)

### Perspectives

* Business
* Data
* Technology
* Infrastructure
* Applications

These are realised as models and views in enterprise architecture frameworks. Models help to give views structure.

## Block 1: Introduction to standards and frameworks

Not a framework, a taxonomy ("The Enterprise Ontologyâ„¢")
