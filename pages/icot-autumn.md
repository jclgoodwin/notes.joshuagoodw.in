## Lecture 1 -- Introduction

Information is...

* a "decrease of ignorance about a source"
* a "decrease of entropy for a variable"

Entropy and information are measured in bits.

Entropy quantifies the number of different values a variable can take.

I could go into more detail but it all makes sense.


## Lecture 2 -- Probability

$$
3^4 + 4
