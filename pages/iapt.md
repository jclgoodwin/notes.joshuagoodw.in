## Lecture 1 -- Introduction

### Architectures

Widespread confusion about what "Model View Controller" is.

"Model View Presenter" is actually more common -- apparently Django is MVP despite claiming to be MVC, for example.

"Presentation Abstraction Control" also exists -- see Drupal, air traffic control systems.


## Lecture 6 -- Events

Events "are external actvites that can be detected by the system".

Feedforward and feedback:

### Feedforward

"Affordances" is a misused word.
"Relatonship between the world and actors".
More specifically, perhaps a relationship between organisms, and environment, and a thing, that provokes some actions.

### Feedback

Was that interaction successful? Did an event happen? What was wrong with my interaction?

There is a checklist of things about good feedback.

Dialog boxes sometimes have buttons, which sort of brings us back to feedforward.

### Implementations

* Callbacks can apparently be horrible
* In the object oriented world, abstract classes
* Event handlers


## Lecture 7 -- Layout

Use things like contrast, hue, shape, size, alignment, to create a visual hierachy.

He says (misuses?) ["ligature"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature) a few times which makes me wince.

### Sorts of layout

He claims that the mobile web is an example of fixed layout -- shows a picture of the Twitter mobile web app.
I think this is wrong.
Early iPhone apps (before multiple screen sizes were envisaged) might be a more correct example?

Springs and struts are horrible, apparently (from Java Swing).

CSS: positioning, floats, make sure you understand it. Takes a lot of practice to become comfortable. (That's OK then!)
